Cross-Platform Movie Recommendation App (UI Demo) 
This project demonstrates the design and initial functionality of a cross-platform movie recommendation app, developed using Flutter and Firebase. The uploaded code provides a demo of the user interface (UI) only, showcasing the app's visually appealing and intuitive design aimed at offering a seamless user experience.

While the demo currently focuses on the UI/UX, the full version of the app includes a personalized recommendation system to increase user engagement, real-time database management, and authentication features powered by Firebase. Additionally, external APIs are integrated to provide users with accurate and up-to-date movie information. The app's interface has been carefully crafted through collaboration on design, ensuring both aesthetic appeal and ease of use across platforms.
